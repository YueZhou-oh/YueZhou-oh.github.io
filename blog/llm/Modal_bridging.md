multimodal instruction tuning.
Formally, a multimodal instruction sample can be denoted in a triplet form, i.e., (I,M,R), where I,M,R represent the instruction, the multimodal input, and the ground truth response, respectively.

> ==\<BOS\>== Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request
> \#\#\# Instruction: \<instruction\>
> \#\#\# Input: {\<image\>, \<text\>}
> \#\#\# Response: \<output\>==\<EOS\>==
